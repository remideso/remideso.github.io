## Federal Education Funding & Racial Disparities in Public Schools

### Project Overview

This project analyzes how race and poverty affect federal education funding across over 11,000 public school districts. The study investigates whether schools serving predominantly minority students are more likely to rely on Title I funding, and how funding disparities align with race and poverty. It includes both exploratory analysis and predictive modeling to better understand how federal support is distributed across districts and which student groups are most affected by shifts in that support.

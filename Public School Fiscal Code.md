## Introduction

Education funding, particularly federal support, has historically been thought of as a central solution in addressing disparities across the nation's school districts. This research explores the connections between racism, poverty, and education funding, particularly focusing on the support from the federal government through Title I dollars. In the wake of the current administration's threat of potential cuts, and the direction of federal attention to public schools, it becomes more important to understand which schools and students are most vulnerable to this potential shift. This research investigates whether schools serving primarily minority students are more likely to receive Title I funding and whether they are at risk of being negatively affected if federal funding is cut.

## Research Topic

Racial and economic disparities often shape how education funding and resources are distributed, influencing the level of support schools can provide. The distribution of resources often depends on various factors, including socioeconomic status, poverty levels, and racial demographics. These factors determine how federal funding is allocated to schools, with Title I funding being a central source of federal support allocated to low-income districts.

## Research Question

This study investigates how race and poverty affect schools’ reliance on Title I funding, and whether schools serving predominantly minority students are more reliant on this federal funding for their resources and operations, especially in the face of potential reductions in funding.

## Methodology

In order to explore the relationship between student demographics, poverty levels, and Title I funding allocation, the study used correlation analysis and logistic regression. It focused on key metrics like Title I revenue, free and reduced-price lunch participation, and total revenue to understand how these factors affect the extent to which districts rely on federal support. This study used a quantitative approach to explore how student racial composition and poverty levels influence school districts’ reliance on federal funding, particularly Title I. After cleaning the dataset, and removing extreme outliers and null values, the dataset included 11,281 school districts with data on student racial demographics and fiscal information. Correlation analysis was used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between student racial composition, poverty indicators, and federal support. For this study, both student percentages and total enrollment counts for Black, Hispanic, White, and American Indian students were included to portray variation across different types of districts. A proportional analysis was conducted in order to better understand which student groups are situated in higher federally funded districts. The amount of Title I funding was categorized into low, medium, and high funding bins, which were created based on the distribution of funding amounts. The share of each racial group within these categories was then calculated to identify where students were concentrated across the funding spectrum. Logistic regression modeling was also used to estimate the likelihood that a district would fall into a given funding tier based on its racial and economic characteristics. This combination of statistical tests helped reveal how race and poverty operate together to shape patterns of federal funding reliance.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed clear patterns between student demographics, poverty, and reliance on Title I funding. Districts with higher concentrations of Black students showed a moderate positive relationship with both federal revenue and Title I funding. A proportional breakdown showed that over 60% of Black students were located in districts classified in the high funding tier, while fewer than 9% were in the low tier. This distribution signals that Black students are more likely to attend schools that depend on federal dollars as a core part of their funding. Hispanic students showed a similar trend, where their enrollment was positively associated with both federal funding and the percentage of students receiving free and reduced-price lunches, showing a strong relationship between poverty and federal support in districts primarily serving this population of students. More than half of Hispanic students were concentrated in high-funding districts, reinforcing the idea that these schools rely on federal support to sustain their basic operations. Although a smaller population, American Indian students followed the same pattern. Roughly 44% were located in high funding districts. Their distribution further supports the connection between minoritized student populations and higher reliance on Title I resources. Lastly, while the raw number of white students showed a moderate positive correlation with federal funding and the total number of students receiving free and reduced-price lunch, they showed a negative correlation with the proportion of Title I funding received. They also showed a negative correlation with the proportion of students receiving free and reduced-price lunches, indicating that districts with larger numbers of white students tend to serve fewer low-income students overall. The proportional breakdown also reflects this distinction where approximately 40% of White students were in high-funding districts, compared to over 60 percent of Black students and over 50% of Hispanic students. This suggests that although some districts with large White student populations receive substantial funding, their overall reliance on Title I is lower.

## Implications

The findings make it clear that if federal education funding gets reduced, schools serving mostly Black, Hispanic, and American Indian students are the ones most likely to feel it. These schools aren’t just receiving Title I funds—they’re depending on them as a crucial source of funding to support their prosperity. The way funding is currently structured means that any cuts won’t hit all schools equally—they’ll hit hardest where the need is most concentrated. The data also pushes back on the idea that federal funding is distributed evenly or purely by income. The proportional breakdown showed that while White students are more evenly spread across all funding levels, Black and Hispanic students are concentrated in districts where Title I dollars carry more weight. The correlation between free and reduced-price lunch and funding makes it clear that poverty drives some of the allocations, but the racial breakdown shows that structural factors are also at play. Therefore any change in federal funding—whether it’s a cut or a shift in priorities—has the potential to hit minority-serving schools the hardest. These are the districts that, according to the data, depend on this funding the most.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights how federal education funding functions as a foundational part of their budgets for schools serving minority student populations. With the increased possibility of federal education cuts, these schools may face disproportionate harm. While Title I is designed to address economic inequality, the findings of this study suggest that racial composition is tied to those students who rely on that funding the most. These findings clarify where reliance on Title I funding is most concentrated and how it aligns with student demographics across districts. Recognizing these patterns is important for any effort aimed at understanding or addressing funding needs across school districts, and identifying which schools may be most affected if that support shifts.
